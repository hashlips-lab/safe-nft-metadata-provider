# Safe NFT Metadata Provider

A simple yet powerful way to protect your NFT tokens from snipers.

## Disclaimer
This project was created for educational purposes, please refer to the [LICENCE](LICENSE) file for further information.

## Main features
- retrieves the collection data about which tokens should be made publicly visible
- hides/reveals the metadata and assets when needed (e.g. on mint, once every N seconds or even based on custom logic)
- works with the [HashLips Labs](https://www.github.com/hashlips-lab)' contracts out-of-the-box, but can be adapted to any collection/contract
- it's extremely customizable _(you can even turn on a light at home on every mint)_
- easy and strong deployment options _(ranging from the newbie to the expert)_
- open-source (for everyone, forever)

## Meant for decentralization
This solution provides a **fair minting experience for everyone**.
Use it during the minting stage, then move your collection back to a decentralized storage option like IPFS.
